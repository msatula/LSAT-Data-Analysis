# LSAT Data Analysis (Data Modeling II - Final Project)  

## Overview  
This project is a statistical analysis of LSAT (Law School Admission Test) multiple-choice questions, conducted as part of our final project for my Data Modeling II (STAT340) class at UW-Madison. For the project, we tested if there was a strategy to guessing the answer to a multiple-choice question that is more likely to be correct that randomly guessing.
